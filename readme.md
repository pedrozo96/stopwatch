# StopWatch v.01

Hello! this stopwatch is based on the knowledge obtained in the course [The Beginner's Guide to Reac](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-introduction-to-the-beginner-s-guide-to-reactjs)t given by  
[Kent C. Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com/) feel free to use it in whatever you want, and if you are so excited as me, go ahead and watch the course of Kent, it's free!

# Project

The project uses [cdns](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/what-is-a-cdn/) to keep simplier the code, here you **wouldn't see webpack** files or files created by the [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), this is a simple stopwatch, also if you are expecting to see something about [Redux](https://es.redux.js.org/), this is not the place either.
